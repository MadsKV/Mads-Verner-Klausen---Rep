                <ul class="ruleList">
                    <h2><u>1. Value your characters</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        Make sure that you think about the consequences of your characters actions. You are not
                        allowed
                        to make a character for a specific scenario to then throw it away (unless cleared with a
                        high
                        ranked staff member first). If you get caught doing so we will add the jail time and the
                        charges
                        on to your main character. You should also fear death and injuries. So don't run into fires,
                        jump off heights or in any way hurt yourself intentionally.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>2. Meta-Gaming</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        Meta-gaming is using Out-of-character or 3rd party information in an in-character context.
                        Doing
                        this will result in a kick or a ban.</li><br>
                    <hr>
                    <h2><u>3. Combat Logging</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        If you're in an active RP situation you do not disconnect to avoid arrest. This means that
                        you
                        may not close your game or quit the game when you are: being arrested, in custody or
                        incapacitated (To not have to wait 5 minutes), or in an RP situation with anybody! If your
                        game
                        crashes make an attempt to find the officer/civilian you were in custody/RPing with and
                        attempt
                        to continue the RP. Come to TeamSpeak support and let someone know if you have crashed.
                        Combat
                        Logging can result in you having your character deleted. This also means that you shouldn‚Äôt
                        start situations you don‚Äôt have time to finish.</li><br>
                    <hr>
                    <h2><u>4. FailRP</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        Make sure everything you do has roleplay involvement. This is a roleplay server, so think to
                        yourself "Could I do this in real life" and if the answer is no, then don't do it! Failing
                        to RP
                        is a bannable offense and is not taken lightly by the staff! Also there is no RP reason to
                        just
                        speed everywhere you go and follow absolutely no traffic laws. Basically, don't FailRP.</li>
                    <hr>
                    <br>

                    <h2><u>5. RDM</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        This rule is common sense and universal among all roleplay servers that exist. Only kill for
                        a
                        valid reason. "Because I'm a criminal" or "I felt like it" is NOT a valid reason to kill
                        someone. Rival gang members, an armed robbery that goes wrong, scenarios like that are
                        alright,
                        but don't make a constant habit of it. It could be viewed as deathmatching and reported.
                    </li>
                    <hr>
                    <br>

                    <h2><u>6. Cop baiting</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        This is a huge one! It goes hand in hand with FailRP usually! If your motive for doing
                        something
                        is "I wanna get caught by the police" or "I wanna get in a police chase," then you're cop
                        baiting! Any act to intentionally grab the attention of the police is cop baiting and will
                        get
                        you banned, so don't do it.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>7. Chat rules</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        LOOC/OOC is out of character chats and should only be used for vital information and/or
                        help. If
                        you need staff to assist you with something you can use /report in the chat or join our
                        TeamSpeak server and use the ‚ÄúSupport Waiting Room‚Äù near the top. Twitter/LifeInvader on the
                        other hand is an in character chat so be careful with what you type in there. Also make sure
                        not
                        to spam any of the chats.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>8. Account/Character rules</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        Only one steam account per person is allowed on the server. Make sure that your character
                        has a
                        realistic first name, last name, date of birth and twitter handle. Names like ‚ÄúT Dog‚Äù would
                        not
                        be allowed as a character name but would be ok as twitter handle. Also make sure that your
                        characters name isn't something inappropriate such as ‚ÄúBen Dover‚Äù or ‚ÄúMike Oxlong‚Äù.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>9. Game functions</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        Do not block or hinder functions of the game. For example placing/leaving a vehicle in a job
                        circle or blocking the door to a hospital. When you plan to disconnect from the server
                        please
                        make sure that your vehicle is parked properly in your garage as it could be stolen and/or
                        impounded while you are gone. Any action taken to abuse the game mechanics will result in a
                        warning, kick and or ban.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>10. Low police presence</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        Civilian on civilian crime is not allowed during low police, such as kidnapping, robbery,
                        etc.
                    </li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>11. Mods/exploits/hacking</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        The only modifications you are allowed on your client is map, sound and/or lighting. If you
                        are
                        caught with any other modifications you will be banned. Abusing game mechanics is not
                        allowed
                        such as using bugs to your own advantage. If you ever find a way to do so, go straight to a
                        staff member and tell them how and what it is. Using a mod menu or a hack of any kind will
                        result in a ban.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>12. IRL Monetary gains</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        No one may charge another player money or gifts in exchange for in-game money.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2>13. Safezones</h2>
                    <li>
                        Kortz Center is the area that people spawn in at. Do not commit any crimes in this area.
                        Doing
                        so will result in a kick or ban.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>14. GTA Online Driving</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        Make sure that what you are doing with your car can be done IRL. Driving a supercar offroad
                        or
                        taking a car onto the train tracks etc is not realistic.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>15. Streaming and or Recording</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        You are allowed to record all you want but please ask any people involved before publishing
                        any
                        videos. As for streaming you will have to apply for a streamer role before you start. Once
                        accepted make sure you read the #streamer-rules on our discord.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>16. No Discrimination/Racism</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        Any discriminatory remarks or comments in relation to Race, Religion, Age, Sex or Sexual
                        orientation will be dealt with harshly by means of an immediate ban. There is no exception
                        to
                        this rule, this means both in and out of role play these actions and comments are completely
                        unacceptable.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>17. Mic requirement</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        To achieve a high standard of RP, we require all players to use a mic in game. If you do not
                        have a mic you will be removed from the game. If you need help please do /report reason or
                        come
                        to our support in TeamSpeak and we will do our best to help get your mic working.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>18. Drug rules</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        You are not allowed to resell drugs to players. The only people allowed to sell drugs to
                        players
                        are the drug faction members. Drug faction members are not allowed to sell their own drugs
                        to
                        NPCs. Do not conduct drug deals near a garage. (Exception to this is if you want to sell on
                        your
                        own property)</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>19. Keep the numbers fair</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        At any sort of illegal activity no more than 5 people per civilian side is allowed. So if
                        you
                        and your friends are doing a bank robbery you are not allowed to be more than 5 people
                        involved.
                        And if your faction is attacking another faction no more than 5 people per faction involved.
                        This is to try and keep it fair for smaller factions and for the cops.</li><br>
                    <hr>

                    <h2><u>20. Teamspeak/Discord rules</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        People use these services to talk and have fun. Make sure that you have a way of muting your
                        mic
                        if you are gonna make a lot of noise. Make sure that your name is relatable to either your
                        character or steam account. Having inappropriate avatars or disconnect messages will not be
                        tolerated.</li><br>
                    <hr>
                    <h2><u>21. Respawning</u></h2>
                    <li>
                        You are not allowed to respawn while in a police situation. Respawning while down is just a
                        shortcut to the hospital which means you would end up arrested anyway. If you are caught
                        respawning you will be brought back and dealt with as if you never went down.</li><br>
                    <hr>
