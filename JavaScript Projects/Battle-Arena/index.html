                <h3>Mage</h3>
                <p>Mages demolish their foes with arcane incantations. Although they wield powerful offensive spells,
                    mages are fragile and lightly armored, making them particularly vulnerable to close-range attacks.
                    Wise mages make careful use of their spells to keep their foes at a distance or hold them in place.

                    and long ranges, hunters are also highly mobile. They can evade or restrain their foes to control
